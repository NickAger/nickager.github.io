"I really enjoy TDD. It’s a comfortable, intentional form of iterative prototyping that mixes well with GTD time management. TDD isn’t a magic bullet for producing good designs though — it’s easy to end up with heavily-tested poor designs. The tests can even become a large drag on improving the design.
I’ve found adding two high-level goals helps reduce the chance of getting stuck with a poor design:
* Maximize correctness; minimize the amount of code.
* Make bad code impossible to write.

Everything being equal - it is better to have less
"What if you could gain the same confidence in correctness with less or simpler tests"
"you would spent less time writing and maintaining, and running tests"

"A type signature is worth a thousand tests"
