If the only tool you have in your toolbox is a SQL Database, then every business problem looks like a stored proceedure.

I plan a blog post on this subject but in the mean-time consider:




* [Designing with types: Discovering new concepts](http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/designing-with-types-discovering-the-domain/)
* [Why Programmers Need Design Patterns to Communicate Effectively](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2044336)
* [Elm programming language & FRP](http://elm-lang.org)
* [Communicating sequential processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes)
* [Actor model of currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model)
* [Compare and Swap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap)
* [Why I'm not a react native developer](https://arielelkin.github.io/articles/why-im-not-a-react-native-developer)

.. but you need to have critical mass in your area of interest, so you don't spend all your time building libraries that already exist in more popular languages.
