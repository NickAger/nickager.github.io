I plan a blog post on this subject but in the mean-time consider:

> Software developers as a species tend to be convinced that programming languages have a grip on the mind strong enough to change the way you approach problems—even to change which problems you think to solve. It’s how they size up companies, products, their peers: “What language do you use?”

.. but you need to have critical mass in your area of interest, so you don't spend all your time building libraries that already exist in more popular languages.
