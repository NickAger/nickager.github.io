In objective-C I used SHXPromise


Options:

http://promisekit.org
https://github.com/FutureKit/FutureKit
https://github.com/Thomvis/BrightFutures
ReactiveCocoa

I liked the functional composition built into Bright Futures


Evaluating 3rd party components
When evaluating a 3rd party library consider the following:

• How many contributors does the code/library/component have?
• Does the library/component contain tests?
• How recent was the last update?
• Is there documentation associated with the component?
• Does the component come with source?
• How is the component licensed: MIT, BSD, Apache = OK; GPL = problems.
• How quickly did fixes go in when a new iOS version is released eg iOS6->iOS6.1->iOS7->iOS7.1->iOS8.0->iOS8.1->... and XCode 4->4.5->5.0->6.0->7.0?
• Does the project make use of recent iOS technologies where appropriate.
• Does the project maintain its own cocoapods spec?
• Does the project have questions on StackOverflow? Are those questions answered?

Just add the above to a table of the above components
