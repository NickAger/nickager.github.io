* Write a swift version of [Why Functional Programming Matters](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf)
* Compare Futures and Promises with ReactiveCocoa and deferred https://github.com/bignerdranch/Deferred
* Compare monoids (and SemiGroup) with composite pattern and null object pattern
* Lenses vs http://faq.sealedabstract.com/structs_or_classes/ (Lenses here https://github.com/typelift/Swiftz), http://narf.pl/posts/lenses-in-swift, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofjehH9f-CU
* RAII in Swift Defer and blocks (eg withFileHandleDo:) and C++, Objective-C
* ReactiveCocoa with the idea of an engine management system (ala http://itchingpixels.com/blog/functional-reactive-intuition-swift/) engine rotation, starter power, and a timer - only run the starter for a certain time; report battery too low etc
* Monad as a "computational context" and object capability -  separation of concerns, least privilege
