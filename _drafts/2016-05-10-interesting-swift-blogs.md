"I really enjoy TDD. It’s a comfortable, intentional form of iterative prototyping that mixes well with GTD time management. TDD isn’t a magic bullet for producing good designs though — it’s easy to end up with heavily-tested poor designs. The tests can even become a large drag on improving the design.
I’ve found adding two high-level goals helps reduce the chance of getting stuck with a poor design:
* Maximize correctness; minimize the amount of code.
* Make bad code impossible to write."
