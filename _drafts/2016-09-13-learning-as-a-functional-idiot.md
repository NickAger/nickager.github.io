Really interesting post - https://www.reddit.com/r/elm/comments/4iu0mj/cant_figure_out_very_basic_examples_in_elm/

> After 20+ years of programming, I feel like a total idiot because I simply cannot comprehend how to do the most basic of basic things in Elm's paradigm.

> The problem that I'm struggling with is that I've been studying Elm for a while, went through tutorials and the Pragmatic videos. I can make complete sense out of any code I read, I fundamentally understand the language and how it works. Then I sit down and try to solve a problem, and it's like everything I've learned in the last 20 years is actually making it worse and not better. I'll just keep pushing through. :) I feel like one of those people that can understand English but can't speak it...
