If you're using MacOS as your client and you're working with GemTools remotely through X11, you may find that it gets confusing having to switch from Mac key shortcuts such as Cmd-b, Cmd-n, Cmd-m... to the subtly different Unix key bindings of Ctrl-b, Ctrl-n, Ctrl-m... 

The solution is to create a key mapping file; ==~/.Xmodmap== to ensure that CMD key functions on the remote GemTools as it does on the local version. ==~/.Xmodmap== contents:
{{{<blockquote><pre>remove Mod2 = Meta_L Meta_R
keysym Meta_L = Control_L
keysym Control_L = Meta_L
keysym Meta_R = Control_R
keysym Control_R = Meta_R
add Mod2 = Meta_L Meta_R
add Control = Control_L Control_R</pre></blockquote>}}}

You also need to change the preferences in the X11 mac app. Ensure the following are disabled:
-''Follow system keyboard layout''.
-''Enable key equivalents under X11''.

You'll have to logout of your remote X session before the key mapping becomes active.
