There's a really helpful guide published by Atlasssian: [Migrate to Git from SVN](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/migrating-overview/)  which lists five steps:

> 1. Prepare your environment for the migration.
> 2. Convert the SVN repository to a local Git repository.
> 3. Synchronize the local Git repository when the SVN repository changes.
> 4. Share the Git repository with your developers via Bitbucket Github.
> 5. Migrate your development efforts from SVN to Git.

Starting the steps:

```bash
$ cp ~/Downloads/svn-migration-scripts.jar ~/
$ cd
$ java -jar ~/svn-migration-scripts.jar verify
$ java -jar ~/svn-migration-scripts.jar create-disk-image 5 GitMigration
$ cd GitMigration
$ java -jar ~/svn-migration-scripts.jar authors "svn://path-to-SVN-respository"  > authors.txt
# the above command generates authors.txt, which then needs editing.
```

Then I hit problems following the Atlasssian: [Migrate to Git from SVN](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/migrating-overview/). The hint of the solution was found [here](https://gist.github.com/trodrigues/1023167). I ended-up splitting the `git svn clone` into `git svn init` followed be editing the `.git/config` file then followed by `git svn fetch`.

For example to import history from SVN I ran:

```bash
$ cd GitMigration
$ git svn init --trunk="/folder/within/repository" "svn://path-to-SVN-respository" GitRepositoryName
```

then edited `GitRepositoryName/.git/config` to read:

```
[core]
    repositoryformatversion = 0
    filemode = true
    bare = false
    logallrefupdates = true
    precomposeunicode = true
[svn-remote "svn"]
    url = svn://path-to-SVN-respository
    fetch = folder/within/repository:refs/remotes/origin/trunk
    branches = ""
    tags = ""
[svn]
    authorsfile = /Users/nickager/GitMigration/authors.txt
```

The main additions to the auto generated `config` are the lines:

```
    branches = ""
    tags = ""
[svn]
    authorsfile = /Users/nickager/GitMigration/authors.txt
```

... as various trials failed to import SVN branches successfully.

then import the SVN history into Git with `git svn fetch`:

```bash
$ cd GitRepositoryName
$ git svn fetch
```

then add a remote and push to the git repository (the repository has to have been created on GitHub before taking this step):

```bash
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/gituser/gitrespository.git
$ git push origin master
```

Finally before the big switch to Git, while people are still checking into SVN, keep the Git repository in sync with changes in SVN  with a bash script to update Github from SVN every 20minutes:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
while true; do
	 echo "*** updating iOS"
	 cd /Volumes/GitMigration/GitRepositoryName
	 git svn fetch
	 git svn rebase
	 git push origin master
	 echo "*** sleeping for 20minutes"
	 sleep 1200
done
```
