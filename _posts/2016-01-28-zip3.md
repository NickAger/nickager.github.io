The Swift standard library includes `zip` which creates a single array containing two element tuples from two arrays. However I wanted  to zip three arrays - previous, next and current values. With open-source Swift it was straight-forward to examine the standard library implementation of [`zip` ](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/stdlib/public/core/Zip.swift) and create `Zip3` :-
