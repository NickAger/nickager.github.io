The left pane shows the older file and the right pane shows the more recent version. On the iPhone the differences are shown in a combined view.

Files are chosen from document providers, such as iCloud Drive, Google Drive, OneDrive etc.

iDiff View shows which characters/words and lines have changed, highlighting additions and deletions.
