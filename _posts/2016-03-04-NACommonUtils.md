I've released some common Swift utilities and extensions I find useful on [GitHub](https://github.com/NickAger/NACommonUtils.git)

They are available as a [Cocoapod](https://cocoapods.org). To incorporate them to your project add the following to your `Podfile` eg:

```ruby
target '<YourProject>' do
    pod 'NACommonUtils', :git => 'git@github.com:NickAger/NACommonUtils.git'
    .
    .
end
```
