When I moved from London to Devon, I was fortunate that the company for whom I was then contracting ([TLC](http://thelearningclinic.co.uk)), valued my work sufficiently to extend my contract and allowed me to work remotely. I worked four days a week in Devon and travelled to London one day a week to catch-up with the team I was managing. This arrangement worked well both for me and the company. I could spend more time with my young family and enjoy the beautiful surroundings of my new location, while  [TLC](http://thelearningclinic.co.uk) kept a talented developer they otherwise might have lost. More importantly, I become far more productive away from the day-to-day distractions of the main office as well as working hard to ensure that I remained closely in-touch with the rest of the team; I felt the onus was on me to show the arrangement not only would work, but would have far more upside for [TLC](http://thelearningclinic.co.uk) than downside.

 A more subtle benefit of remote working is that the only way people can judge how well you are working is via the measurable delivery of features requested by customers. The danger of office work is that it is often sufficient to be seen to be working hard, regardless of how productive you actually are.

However moving from London has one large downside - London is where a [disproportionate number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_agglomeration) of the software jobs in the UK are based. Understandably employers faced with two applicants; one remote and one who can commute to the office will pick the local applicant assuming the two have equal skills.

It's great then that there are sites such as [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com) designed specifically for remote freelancers, who help source top remote talent for enlightened companies looking for the best developers wherever they might live. Unlike many sites that simply let anyone through the door, [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com) have a screening process that they claim only allows 3% of applicants through. I'm applying to join the [Toptal Swift engineering community](https://www.toptal.com/swift) and looking forward to learning about the screening process firsthand.

One thing I'm learning is that unlike London where seeking work can result in an [embarrassment of riches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassment_of_riches), living in a remote location requires job seekers to be more resourceful. Sites such as [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com) are a useful tool in that search.
