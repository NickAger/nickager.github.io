### Seafox
A [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) plug-in and on-line html converter which translates Html into Seaside canvas methods. For example:

```
   <a href='http://www.seaside.st'>Seaside site</a>
```
is translated into:

```smalltalk
html anchor url: 'http://www.seaside.st' with: 'Seaside site'.
```
See [Seafox](http://seafox.seasidehosting.st)

### Seaside web-framework
I was one of the co-maintainers of the [Seaside web-framework](seaside.st) and managed a number of releases.
