I am a <a href="#github-contributions" rel="leanModal">hands-on</a> senior iOS Developer with over 20 years commercial programming experience and over 4 years experience developing commercial iPhone/iPad applications.

Although I am very focused on iOS development, I do have significant senior management experience which is often useful in project planning, execution, team mentoring and in client-facing situations.

I am focused on the maintainability of the code I write and develop with others. I find maintainability brings a focus on testability, automation, separation of concerns, evolving systems sympathetically with their original intent, using appropriate technologies, making illegal states unrepresentable and removing barriers to iteration speed.

Developed award winning iOS apps for patient observation recording, tracking and escalation between <a href="#vitalpac-nurse" rel="leanModal">nurses</a> and <a href="#vitalpac-doctor" rel="leanModal">doctors</a> within hospitals.

* Recruited, led and mentored an iOS development team.
* Modernised a legacy code-base by introducing well defined protocols between components and encouraged coding standards based on industry best practice.
* Refactored the code-base to be more maintainable and testable, with single-responsibility and dependency injection.
* Introduced modern iOS technologies such as auto-layout, ARC, Cocoapods etc
* Dramatically simplified and removed a class of bugs from networking code by eliminating developer produced multi-threaded code, and other asynchronous code by unifying under [promises](https://promisesaplus.com).
* Solved long-standing client facing issues with dynamic logging, improved diagnostics and remote and on-site trouble-shooting.
* Added a visual component test harness, which decreased the coupling between components, improved developer and tester productivity and reduced defect rates.
